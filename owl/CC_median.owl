The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations.

These subunits are organized into 3 functionally essential sub-assemblies: the pol III core, the beta sliding clamp processivity factor and the clamp-loading complex. The pol III core carries out the polymerase and the 3'-5' exonuclease proofreading activities. The polymerase is tethered to the template via the sliding clamp processivity factor. The clamp-loading complex assembles the beta processivity factor onto the primer template and plays a central role in the organization and communication at the replication fork."^^xsd:string,

In eukaryotes they are flattened, membrane-bounded disk-like structures located in the chloroplasts; in the chloroplasts of higher plants the thylakoids form dense stacks called grana. Isolated thylakoid preparations can carry out photosynthetic electron transport and the associated phosphorylation."^^xsd:string,
